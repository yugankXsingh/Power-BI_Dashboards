## Introduction

This dashboard was created for **Job Seekers, Job Transitioners, and Job Swappers** to solve a common problem: information about the data job market is scattered and hard to grasp. Using a real-world dataset of 2024 data science job postings (including titles, salaries, and locations), this project provides a single, easy-to-use interface to explore market trends and compensation.
